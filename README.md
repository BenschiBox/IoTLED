# IoTLED

The aim of this Project is to create, setup and program an Internet of Things device / network capable of managing and controlling adressable LED-Strips like WS2813.

For now the goal is to control 2 LED-Strips over an android app, in which the user can select between different lightning setups and also a Music-Visualizer mode using an AUX input.

## Built with
* [arduino-esp32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) - Arduino Core for ESP32
* [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED) - Library for controlling the LEDs

## Tremendous help from here
